# About
This will contain resources and information regarding our equity, inclusion, and accesibility roadmap. Our goal is to attract, retain and promote a diverse community of instructors and learners and foster an environment of inclusion. We also provide figures for who The Carpentries is reaching in our global workshops. We collect information for learner status/position and field of research/work globally. Additionally, we collect data for gender identity and racial/ethnic identity for U.S. workshop participants.
