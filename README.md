# About
This folder contains resources and information regarding our diversity and inclusion strategies, programs, policies, and metrics that will attract, retain and promote a diverse community of instructors and learners and foster an environment of inclusion. We also provide figures for who The Carpentries is reaching in our global workshops. We collect information for learner status/position and field of research/work globally. Additionally, we collect data for gender identity and racial/ethnic identity for U.S. workshop participants. All figures were created using data from SurveyMonkey for attendees who completed our pre-workshop surveys.
