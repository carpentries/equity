# README

This folder contains demographic data for all badged Carpentries Instructors. 

+ instructor-demographics-gender-country includes one row for each badged Instructor (SWC, DC, or LC) showing the Instructors gender and country. Note that instructors with more than one badge are only listed once in this file.

+ instructor-demographics-domain includes up to multiple rows for each badged Instructor. Instructors who have more than one domain of expertise are listed one time for each domain. The person_id variable can be used to get a count of total number of Instructors represented, though this will sum to more than 100%.
