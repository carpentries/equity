# About
This folder contains demographics for who we are reaching in our global workshops. We collect information for learner status/position and field of research/work globally. Additionally, we collect data for gender identity and racial/ethnic identity for U.S. workshop participants.

All figures were created using data from SurveyMonkey for attendees who completed our pre-workshop surveys.
