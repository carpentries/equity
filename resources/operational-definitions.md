## Operational Definitions

**Accessibility**  
Program/process design and implementation that offers multiple avenues for access and participation.

**Cultural Competence**  
The state of having and applying knowledge and skill in four areas: 
1. awareness of one’s own cultural worldview; 
2. recognition of one’s attitudes toward cultural differences; 
3. realization of different cultural practices and worldviews; and 
4. thoughtfulness in cross-cultural interaction. 

**Diversity**   
*Individual differences* (e.g. personality, language, learning preferences and life experiences) and group-social differences (e.g. race, ethnicity, class, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual identity, country of origin and ability status, as well as cultural, political, religious or other affiliations) *that can be engaged in the service of learning.*   

**Equity**  
The creation of opportunities for equal access to and participation in programs that are capable of closing participation gaps in our community.

**Inclusion**   
The active, intentional, and ongoing engagement of diverse people and communities that increases awareness, content knowledge, and empathic understanding of the ways we interact within (and change) our community. 


Over an extended period of time, individuals and organizations develop the wisdom and capability to: 
1. Examine critically how cultural worldviews influence perceptions of power, dominance and inequality; and 
2. Behave honorably within the complex dynamics of differences and commonalities among humans, groups and systems.
