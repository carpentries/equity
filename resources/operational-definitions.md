## Operational Definitions

**Diversity**   
*Individual differences* (e.g. personality, language, learning styles and life experiences) and group-social differences (e.g. race, ethnicity, class, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual identity, country of origin and ability status, as well as cultural, political, religious or other affiliations) *that can be engaged in the service of learning.*   

**Inclusion**   
The active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity in people, curriculum, and communities (intellectual, social, cultural, geographical) with which individuals might connect in ways that increase their awareness, content knowledge, cognitive sophistication and empathic understanding of the complex ways individuals interact within (and change) systems and institutions. 

**Equity (Learner)**  
The creation of opportunities for equal access to and participation in educational programs that are capable of closing the achievement gaps in learner success and completion.   

**Equity (Volunteer/Community Member)**  
The creation of opportunities for volunteers/community members to have equal access to professional growth opportunities and resource networks that are capable of closing demographic disparities in leadership roles and other spheres of institutional involvement. 

**Cultural Competence**  
The state of having and applying knowledge and skill in four areas: 
1. awareness of one’s own cultural worldview; 
2. recognition of one’s attitudes toward cultural differences; 
3. realization of different cultural practices and worldviews; and 
4. thoughtfulness in cross-cultural interaction. 

Over an extended period of time, individuals and organizations develop the wisdom and capability to: 
1. Examine critically how cultural worldviews influence perceptions of power, dominance and inequality; and 
2. Behave honorably within the complex dynamics of differences and commonalities among humans, groups and systems.
